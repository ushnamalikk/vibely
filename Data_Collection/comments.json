I could never explain how much I love her. I wish I could love her by the last breath of my life. She was a blessing in my life.  together we were in our best versions. Nowadays I see her everywhere, this is not a kind of funny illusion, it actually happening to me, maybe it is the effect of her love. I would say Love is not about staying together, It's about the bonding we made together. I don't know if she still loves me or not, but I believe she also feels the same as I do. the thing is like, we are made for each other. But there is a word called \"FAASLE\"... I still believe we will be together someday. She taught me what is love, and now I am looking for her to make her smile for the rest of my life. ",

(Mos Def) mathematics, numbers don't lie bro, ayy\nDar'asal hum sub musafir aur muqeem bhi\nHustle so I get paid, sath khati team bhi\nBuy you motherfuckers out! Pha'ar dun raseed bhi\nAqal pakar k bhi ye opal hain aqeeq nahi\n30K for this ring, yahan kuch cheap nahi (nope)\nGawah rehna kaha thaa mai nahi hun teree reach mai\nCelebratin' daily. Ab kiya weekdays, kiya weekends?\nLarkay karte balance loose wearing all those cheapskates\nI made your Mrs. come and say my name while she did it\nFly her to Malaysia, kharch karun Ringgit\nI bring it to the table. You people just got served\nTum detay nahi ho logic, all that talk is absurd\nYe shehar mera, iski gawahi ye shehar deraha\nWo shehar tera uss me teray se ziyada fan mera\nMai teri le nahi raha, mai sirf tujeh stats deraha\nInternet pe garmi maat do asal mai hun banda terhaa\n(asal mai hun banda terhaa)",

        "Lyrics\n\n\n\nKyun? Kahan?\nYeh kaisa faisla hai\nMein tujhse door raha\nYeh milon faasla hai\n\nAur ab mein hun kahan?\nKe tum sa koi ab milta nahi\nAur tum sa jo, jo khilta sahi\nPar hum kya karein?\n\nTu pyaar ya khayal hai mera\nTu pehla malaal hai mera\nMein jadugar hun qalam ke saath\nTu pehla kamal hai mera\nAb mujhe teri yaad aaye boht\nMein karun tujhe ek text aur\nBut you don't give a fuck about me\nBatade jaana ghar kab aayegi\nPohanch jayen ge paigham ki tarah\nDhal jayen kisi shaam ki tarah\nTu dhoondti phirrey humein sheher bhar may\nApne qeemti samaan ki tarah\nHum tere maizban naa sahi\nShab-e-gham koi aasan naa rahi\nMein seekh kar betha hun dil behlanay ka hunar\nTere aane k–µ asaar naa kahin\nAb jou muskura de\nMere har zakham ko marham dastiyab ho\nTu jou gunguna d–µ\nKoyalo ki dhun sa lagay izhar ho\nTu jou galay laga le\nJaise har kali ki mehak bekaar ho\nTum kya ho tum khud nahi jaanti\nYeh sub mere saath har baar ho\n\nKyun? Kahan?\n\nYeh kaisa faisla hai\nMein tujhse door raha\nYeh milon faasla hai\nAur ab mein hun kahan?\nKe tum sa koi ab milta nahi\nAur tum sa jo, jo khilta sahi\nPar hum kya karein?\n\nTum se milay tou theek, naa milay tou dil yeh\nKhanjaron se chaak hogya, aur sarr pe\nBojh pareshaniyon ka, but I'm clocked in\nStudio may laga rehta ladka raat din\nBottom of the bottom jani, you know I've been\nNow I'm at the top jaise mein koi hakim\nSangaton ne rang badle, they've been talking\nNaa aaye motbar, naa aayi maut bhi\nJanam meri zindagi hai ghazal bangyi\nTu insaaf na kare,\n\n\n\n tu adal bangyi\nTujhse lakhon meel jaise tu ho chaand\nTeri roshni ab kashish-e-saqal si bangyi\nNa tootnay se tootay woh qasam si bangyi\nMein likhun shayari, tu adab si bangyi\nJo chhor di adhoori woh nazam si bangyi\nMein yaad karun tujhko, tu sabaq si bangyi\nPhir umeed kyun jagati ho?\nTum kahan ho? Kya siyahi may samati ho?\nHamesha dair kar deta hun mein pata hai na\nTou meri jaan tum bhi waqt par kyun aati ho?\nHum khudse baaghi hain ya bekhabar\nNaa maut aati hai, na he sabar\nTu he na mila mujhe agar\nTou mein faaslay badhaun tum se bus\n\nTu kheenche apni or\n\nNaa chalta khud pe zor\nTu daalay aisi dor\nI'm hoping, you don't let it go, let it go\n\n\n\n\nChhoro yeh bahane yeh kahaniyan\nBadhao na tum dil ki pareshaniyan\nHum pehle aashiq tou nahi hain jaaneman\nYeh ishq khaa gya badi jawaniyan\nMein iss farash se jurr ke boht khush\nKya karein teri hawayen hain sawariyan\nHum khogye hain khud may\nMil ke nahi de rahe\nAb kya Eid kya Diwaliyan, hmm\n\nBus ek jhalak jou dikh jaye mujhe teri\nTou shuru karein hum eid ki tayariyan\nMein iss farash se jurr ke boht khush\nBaadalon se hain lagayi tu ne yaariyan\nTere samaan se bhari meri almariyan\nMatt karo tum aur mazeed meharbaniyan\nMein bus dil ki baat kehne wala tha tumhe\nPar kisi ne mujhko neend se jaga diya\nMaahir hogya hun mein bhi ab tadapne may\nTou kyun darenge hum bhi dil ko rakhne may\nBadal gye ho tum bhi ya pata nahi\nTum aise tou nahi the mere sapne may\n\nKyun? Kahan?\nYeh kaisa faisla hai\nMein tujhse door raha\nYeh milon faasla hai\nAur ab mein hun kahan?\nKe tum sa koi ab milta nahi\nAur tum sa jo, jo khilta sahi\n\nPar hum kya karein?"
