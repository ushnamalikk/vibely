If they agree with me then they will definitely like it . Just commented to describe my feelings that's it. Everyone else are just fighting with each other by his judging whether that guy belongs to our country or not. Whether he is Hindu OR Muslim. C'mon guys talent is pure it's don't have any of this. Every talented person have his own identity and there this type of stupid debates are not arises. \n\n\nThank You ",

I could never explain how much I love her. I wish I could love her by the last breath of my life. She was a blessing in my life.  together we were in our best versions. Nowadays I see her everywhere, this is not a kind of funny illusion, it actually happening to me, maybe it is the effect of her love. I would say Love is not about staying together, It's about the bonding we made together. I don't know if she still loves me or not, but I believe she also feels the same as I do. the thing is like, we are made for each other. But there is a word called \"FAASLE\"... I still believe we will be together someday. She taught me what is love, and now I am looking for her to make her smile for the rest of my life. ",

        "Mr. Rahman, you have been my favorite Indian composer since I began watching films in 2008 after the first anniversary of my daughter death from a long-time illness. Your music helped me so much in those first year as purchased many films. I eventually learned to recognize your music without checking the credits because of your distinctive style.  I have seen the first two films of Vasundhara Das and have enjoyed her acting as well as her singing.  She is a gifted artist in both crafts and her voice is also very recognizable for the lyrical quality and emotional context she presents. \n\nYou have provided the loveliest musical tapestries in which several of my favorite films have been incorporated. I have the soundtracks to Dil Se, Taal, Swades, Lagaan, Jodhaa Akbar, and Slumdog Millionaire. Each one contains such deep emotional resonance with the film that moves me to laughter, cheers, tears, contemplation, hope, and joy whenever I watch them. Lagaan and Swades especially have often inspired me when I have had very difficult challenges. All the stories are powerful, yet your music gives them life. It encouraged me deeply during the first years of mourning for my daughter. Something very spiritual happens with the chords and notes as they reach our painful feelings and turns us towards hope. Contemporary western music seldom meets one's needs when we experience this sorrow because our culture has a fierce resistance to expressing it after loved ones die. Many Hindi films helped me grieve in full measure so that I could eventually heal.\n\nIt ihas been a rich blessing to hear your gorgeous, sensitive music. Thank you so much for what you have shared with the world and with this older listener in the Pacific Northwest State of Washington in the US.",

(Mos Def) mathematics, numbers don't lie bro, ayy\nDar'asal hum sub musafir aur muqeem bhi\nHustle so I get paid, sath khati team bhi\nBuy you motherfuckers out! Pha'ar dun raseed bhi\nAqal pakar k bhi ye opal hain aqeeq nahi\n30K for this ring, yahan kuch cheap nahi (nope)\nGawah rehna kaha thaa mai nahi hun teree reach mai\nCelebratin' daily. Ab kiya weekdays, kiya weekends?\nLarkay karte balance loose wearing all those cheapskates\nI made your Mrs. come and say my name while she did it\nFly her to Malaysia, kharch karun Ringgit\nI bring it to the table. You people just got served\nTum detay nahi ho logic, all that talk is absurd\nYe shehar mera, iski gawahi ye shehar deraha\nWo shehar tera uss me teray se ziyada fan mera\nMai teri le nahi raha, mai sirf tujeh stats deraha\nInternet pe garmi maat do asal mai hun banda terhaa\n(asal mai hun banda terhaa)",

Stunner\nBitch you wanna vibe in the high zone, yeah\n\nBitch you wanna be a Young Stunner\nBitch you wanna vibe in the high zone, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Talhah Yunus]\nShe wanna roll with me\nShe throw it back, she don‚Äôt wanna see the sober me\nI‚Äôll take you overseas, jo bhi chahiye mu pe bol mai koi chor tou nai\nTu bore tou nai, koi call tou nai, koi aur tou nai\nKarachi se Lahore gaanay bajen, bass khol tou sahi\nTu ghaur kar bhai choray abhi hain moaqal nai\nDhunde mauqay nai, kuttay sirf bhonktay\nMai likhta real talk baby, issi ki monopoly\nDunye ye bebaak bari, hum hi yahan k pac biggie\nKhelu mai bhi saanp seerhi , KRS aur Rakim bhi\nKitni aur shanakht du jo haqq ka nai woh khata nai\nBantu mai hikmat ho baby deewani\nMunni badnaam nai, aur sheela jawaan nai\nHarami ye launday harami\nPaapi puranay gaanay mere yaad hain zabani\nDil ruba, ye dil dukha hai\nMai woh shayar jis ki shayari mai ilm chupa hai\nMehfil subah tak, bill chuka ke chalay\nVerses technical itne log kehte hill chuka ye\nAaj 12 baje\nTy in the buildin panties drop muu pe 12 baje\nMere aagay lagen, raaten jaagay hum dekh\nBaby, mujhe DM karay theek raat.... hahaha\n\n[Chorus: Talha Anjum]\n12 bajay, badlay iraaday humaray\n12 bajay, tu ne khud ko tha dia mujhay\nWo mujhay lagay like a model\nUske liye laaya puri bottle\nAaj ke baad jo mil na sakein\nTou bhool jaa jo hua 12 bajay",
